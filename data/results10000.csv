Contributions to the core system design are highly welcome.<p>This project stems from unsatisfactory use of other existing projects regarding financial exchanges, and is of interest for the bitcoin community since cryptocoins are among the tradeable assets in the software.<p>Diffusion to other news sites is appreciated.<p>Subscribe just sending an email to: denarius@librelist.com

"  Free Class on ""Playing with Ruby"" - Jan 5th - Boulder, CO",1,"For anyone in the Denver-Boulder, Colorado area wanting to dip their toes into the water of learning Ruby, here's your chance.<p>Ask any software developer how they first learned to program. Maybe at some point they read books or attended classes, but ultimately they had to learn by trial and error: by typing in some code and seeing what happened. You learn your first programming language by playing with code, just like you learned your first spoken language by playing with sounds.<p>In this workshop you'll work with some Ruby code that draws an image on the screen. Your job is to change the image by changing the code. The goal is to give everyone first-hand experience with variables, loops, branches, and the command line. You'll figure it out faster than we can explain it, so let's get started.<p>Light food, snacks, and refreshments will be provided.<p>NOTE:  Please bring a computer or be ready to share. If it has Windows, please download and install Ruby from rubyinstaller.org before the workshop.<p>DAVINCI CODERS:  For anyone wanting to know more about DaVinci Coders (www.davincicoders.com), this is a great way to get started. Please plan to join us for this remarkable event... and the best part, it's FREE.<p>EVENT: Playing with Ruby

"  do you find our idea interesting?",1,"so much of the experience we record through pictures, videos, audio, etc. are lost in private silos such as private streams to facebook friends.   But many of those things are relavent to everyone in the world.   For example, if I take a video of the pyrymid and upload to facebook, my friends will see it but soon it will be buried under tons of new posts and lost even though this video is relavent for everyone in the world to see.    We are builing an app that allow you to take videos, audio, picture, comments and seamlessly and easily upload to a public map so that everyone in the world can see them.  There are services such as google panoramio but it only does pictures and no mobile app for easy upload.    Instagram has a way to upload to only a private map.  No one is doing it right.   We are creating the alpha version of this app and here is a demo scribbleeverywhere.com    any suggestions, feedbacks, comments are greatly appreciated!",0,http://scribbleeverywhere.com,1379013313

" 500 Million. That's Your Competition",1,"launch.nexxr.com
We haven't launched yet but we'll be live early June. Be first to join Nexxr and sign up to our email list and we'll let you know as soon as we're up and running.
Yes. There are 500 million active websites on the planet. Well that's what they say, in actual fact the figure is estimated anywhere between 400-700 million. Imagine that. The web's like an open world which means you compete with almost everybody and anybody. So let's take 500 million, essentially you're competing with 1 in every 12 people in the world. Almost impossible, don't you think?
So how do you as a beginner, a small website just starting out make yourself known in this overpopulated world wide web. Now's the time I tell you about my startup. Before we get there, their is something I'd like to point out. The intention of this article is not solely to introduce you to my startup but to introduce to you the future of what it can become.
It's advertising platform for those of us who don't have a seven figure advertising budget. It's a combination of the concept of link exchange and traditional advertising. Something we like to call ""ad sharing"". It's a startup, so ultimately the goal is to become a business but the idea does have a hint of purpose, at least we think so.
The idea is simple, you display users ads on your website and other users will do the same for you. Imagine if we could connect millions of websites together, a unified web. Where we all keep in touch with each others websites, like a social news platform on the move that goes wherever you go. Constantly be in the loop of what's the latest and greatest on the web: new deals, trending stories, news, articles, games, everything. Ads can become interactive and can learn your interests as you browse the internet. The possibilities run far
That's our dream, to change the way we advertise online. Turning advertising into something that doesn't have to be complicated or insanely expensive. As we grow we hope to move forward with our mission and make it happen.

" Ask HN: Is there a way to make Google web search work like it used to?",2,"Hi HN community.<p>I, the same, as pretty much everyone, used to very much enjoy Google's way of doing web search. With that I mean the old way of only listing results that contained <i>all</i> the words one had searched for. This started changing a couple of years ago, and has made my work as a Sysadmin harder when searching for error messages (you can sometimes get around this by using quotes or adding plus signs before each word, but not always).<p>For an example of this sad, sad behaviour I challenge you to do a web search for ""linux notebook basketball"", visit the first result and find the word 'notebook' anywhere in the page.<p>So: do you know of a way to make Google default to the older and in my opinion saner behaviour? Alternatively: is there a better option available for the times when you really do know what you want to search for?<p>Thank you for your time.",3,,1314466922

" Ask HN: Minecraft blueprint app with proven demand. Interested in contributing?",5,"Being done with university classes and in a transition period between academic pursuits and my career as an entrepreneur, I wanted to create a fun side project and the concept of a blueprint builder for Minecraft came to mind (after working to build a complex structure in Minecraft myself). The goal is to create an app that makes planning a Minecraft structure easy—dare I say fun—and helpful by letting users know the amount of materials required and to provide instructions for creating the structure in-game.<p>I created a few mock ups showcasing how the app will function and posed a question gauging interest (links below) to the /r/Minecraft community a few nights ago before heading to bed at 3:00AM. I woke up and was expecting to find a handful of comments; maybe two or three. There were sixty. SIXTY comments before 8:30AM! Over the course of the day, it grew to 170+ comments, all positive saying they want this app—my favorite being, ""Shut up and take my money!!! Really looking forward to this! Will save me so much pain,"" which turned out to be a common sentiment.<p>Reddit thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/i04lm/who_would_be_interested_in_using_this_blueprint/<p>Mock up: http://i.imgur.com/gBIv6.png<p>Mock up with key features shown/explained: http://i.imgur.com/klihn.png<p>So here I am on HN looking for a technical partner to help create a beautiful app that helps solve a major problem Minecraft players have. You need to play Minecraft yourself or be willing to get your hands dirty in-game and able to devote the time to release the app very quickly (with minimal features). This is meant to be a for-profit project, but more importantly it's for fun and as a means to showcase our talents!<p>Please check out the Reddit post first and send me an email (in my HN profile) if you want to contribute! I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well.",0,,1308610212

" Ask HN: Was it a good decision for Mixergy to become a paid service?",2,"I really love all that Andrew Warner has done. In fact, I probably listen to an interview or two each week. But I don't think the subscription model is a good one, especially for $25 a month. Maybe something cheaper, like $5 would be palatable. And it's weird that there's no set price; you can pay either $25 or $50 or $100 for the same service.<p>But I do understand Andrew wanting to get paid for his admittedly-excellent archive of work. I would too. So, I don't like the subscription switch (or the price), but I respect it. Still, I think the entire business model is flawed. It's only the dated videos - one week or older - that you need to pay for. So, I think the vast majority of listeners will simply tune in for the current week's fare, and tune out everything else.<p>Maybe I'm just naive - or even cynical. But I'm not sure.<p>What do you guys think about Mixergy's transition?",1,,1266796285

" Ask HN: What to consider when open-sourcing my app?",1,"First, an introduction: Spendful.com is a budgeting tool that lets you track your spending manually. The unique (maybe not?) thing it does is forecast your balance in the future to help you plan better. For those in the US, yes Mint.com is better for tracking spending - but I don&#x27;t agree with linking bank accounts because that defeats the purpose of developing a habit of tracking where your money goes.<p>I&#x27;ve realised it isn&#x27;t good enough to make it as a business in it&#x27;s current state and I&#x27;m not able to give it the time that&#x27;s required to improve it fast enough to keep up with others. There are ~11k signups so I know some people must find it useful. 7 people pay for premium even though there are no premium features (it did have a 60 day trial as of a month ago but I&#x27;ve since removed that restriction).<p>My question: What should I be considering when converting an app to be open source? I&#x27;ve made the repo public but I don&#x27;t have any experience with open source (other than using it) or if this is even worth-while?<p>- Should the business model change to be free for everyone on the hosted version at spendful.com?
 - How do I restrict the open-ness of it to just the code and not the brand, design e.t.c.?<p>My goal is to have people improve it with me, host their own or use the hosted option at Spendful.com.<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

" Egypt's Mubarak detained, army win protest respite",1," An Egyptian policeman stands guard outside Sharm el-Sheikh hospital where former president Hosni Mubarak was admitted after he reportedly suffered a heart attack Tuesday during questioning by prosecutors. PHOTO: AFP<p>CAIRO: Hosni Mubarak was ordered detained for 15 days on Wednesday, winning the ruling army generals a respite from protests by quashing suspicions that they were shielding their former commander from investigation.<p>Mubarak, driven from presidential office on Feb 11 by mass demonstrations against his 30-year rule, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday suffering what state media called a “heart crisis”. Reports conflicted on the seriousness of his illness.<p>The public prosecutor had summoned and questioned Mubarak over the killing of protesters, embezzling of public funds and abuse of power. More than 380 protesters were killed in 18-days of demonstrations that led to Mubarak’s downfall.<p>“Former President Hosni Mubarak was detained for 15 days for investigation,” state television reported. It said his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, have also been questioned as part of the probe and ordered detained.<p>In his first public comment since stepping down, broadcast on Al Arabiya on Sunday, Mubarak denied wrongdoing.<p>An army helicopter landed near Mubarak’s hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh on Wednesday to take the former president to Cairo, Al Jazeera reported. One security source told Reuters that Mubarak could be moved to Cairo or the outskirts to assist the probe.<p>There was no official confirmation. Another security source earlier said Mubarak was expected to stay in Sharm el-Sheikh.<p>The official news agency also said it was not yet determined where Mubarak would be taken. It reported heavy security around the hospital in the Red Sea resort.<p>The source said Mubarak’s sons were taken to a prison on the outskirts of Cairo, joining a list of ex-ministers and officials under investigation and held in the same jail.<p>Gamal, 47, Mubarak’s younger son, held a top post in the ruling party. Many Egyptians believed he was being groomed for top office, although both father and son denied any such plan.<p>“This is a serious step forward in holding the president accountable and ends any suspicion that the state and the military were in cahoots with Mubarak,” said Hassan Nafaa, a political scientist and activist for reform.<p>“We want our money”<p>Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protested on Friday in Cairo’s Tahrir Square over delays in trying Mubarak and criticised Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the army council head who was Mubarak’s defence minister for 20 years.<p>“The military council moved fast because of the pressure protesters have built up in Tahrir. In the past weeks there has been real criticism of Tantawi and the military council that they are slow and looking after Mubarak as their commander,” said Shadi Ghazali Harb, from a pro-democracy youth movement.<p>He said plans for another protest on Friday were on hold to see how swiftly the army and prosecutor moved towards a trial.<p>Political analyst Fahmy Hueidi said: “The army succumbed to people pressure to bring Mubarak and family to justice.”<p>On Tuesday, soldiers broke up a five-day sit-in at Tahrir Square, the epicentre of Egypt’s uprising in January.<p>Protesters had vowed to keep up the pressure, although many ordinary Egyptians are tired of the protests that have hammered the economy and disrupted their lives.<p>There were conflicting reports about Mubarak’s condition. A state television report said he was in intensive care after a “heart crisis” during questioning. Al Arabiya said he was fit enough to be questioned in hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh.<p>The timing of his health setback prompted skepticism among some protesters about the motives of the army, which has pushed for swift elections to hand over power. The army praised and thanked Mubarak when he left office, but protesters criticized him for ruling by emergency law and widening a rich-poor divide.<p>“We want our money. We want the thief to be tried,” chanted dozens of people near the hospital on Tuesday in the resort where Mubarak spent more and more time before leaving office.<p>Diplomats say there is no sign the military wants to hold on in government but say it may loom in the background as the nation’s self-appointed guardian.<p>Mubarak has suffered from health problems in recent years and went to Germany for gall bladder surgery in March 2010.<p>There were frequent rumours about his health as he aged, particularly after his last bout of surgery.<p>Mubarak vowed to die in Egypt when he addressed the country’s 80 million people shortly before he stepped down.<p>After Friday’s demonstration, soldiers and police used tasers and batons to try to drive out the protesters after nightfall. Medical sources said 13 men were wounded by gunfire and two died. The army denied using live ammunition.<p>Angry protesters demanded the army hand power to civilians, but soldiers moved in on Tuesday to end the sit-in. Soldiers with rifles rounded up several young men and pushed them into vans. They gathered up barbed wire used by demonstrators to block the square and dismantled makeshift barriers.",0,http://www.pakistannationalnews.com/world/egypts-mubarak-detained-army-win-protest-respite/,1303234750

I suspect it is this way because it came out of the minds of designers rather than programmers...and DHH's attitude is ""F You"" so it will never improve...  but maybe I'm just spoiled having used WebObjects.   <p>I ended up writing my own web app platform in about 3 months-- custom language, integrated persistence engine and http-server, no-thought-required concurrency... so I'm happy now.   I'm just kinda surprised that more people haven't done this.<p>If you don't have the time to do your own solution, use Erlyweb (which is hampered by being ""Rails for erlang"") or WebObjects (which is hampered by running on Java). <p>Anyway, I expect that the outperformance of Erlyweb compared to rails will be more dramatic-- in excess of 10 to 1, when running a more complex application, and even higher when running on a multicore cpu.",11,http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2007/12/09/erlyweb-vs-ruby-on-rails-ec2-performance-showdown/,1197283606

" I Think Security Wins OmniCompete’s Cyber Security Challenge III ",1,"After pitching its data security solution QI before a live audience of investors, industry, government, VCs and peers, I Think Security Ltd has been named the winner of the Cyber Security Challenge III: Data Leakage, in an annual competition aimed at bringing out the best innovations with solutions to prevent, detect, track and mitigate data leakage.   I Think Security Ltd’s data protection device QI now holds the title of ‘Best Cyber Security Product’.  Period.<p>With over $117million in total acquisitions and investments as a result of their competitions, and attracting industry sponsors such as BAE, Thales Group UK, the United States Army, the United States Navy and Digital Barriers, OmniCompete is a world-leader in high quality innovation competitions.<p>I Think Security is the first Canadian company to win this prestigious international award.   “We are so proud and honoured to have won the Cyber Security Challenge, this gives our early stage company tremendous credibility in the market place,” said Dr. Cedric Jeannot, I Think Security CEO and founder.<p>QI is a USB device that allows corporate and personal users to secure files and folders, independently of their location, in just 3 clicks. QI protects sensitive files while allowing users to share encrypted volumes with other QI users. Easy to use, it can be deployed immediately across a company with no training or tech support. With QI, I Think Security now puts digital security right in the palm of its user’s hand.<p>Dr. Jeannot says that “the greatest vulnerabilities exploited by a hacker come from the people.  A data protection product must take into account the end-user by being easy to use and non-invasive.”  This proved to be true as QIs bulletproof security and ease of use immediately caught the judge’s attention.<p>During his pitch to Cyber Security Challenge attendees, Dr. Jeannot emphasised QI’s ease and low cost of deployment. “QI’s ability to be deployed immediately on top of existing infrastructures without training or tech support is of tremendous value.  A company can literally deploy QI to 10,000 users tomorrow if they choose.”<p>Working on any operating system, when QI is plugged into a computer it transforms the computer immediately into a secure endpoint.  No data is stored on QI as it is not a storage device.<p>QI marries leading-edge security technology with convenience and easy management, surpassing any data security product on the market today. The product uses two-factor authentication, proprietary key management, and anti-forensics technology providing a more robust solution such that even if your infrastructure is compromised, QI guarantees your data remains secure.<p>I Think Security Ltd. is tackling the problem of data theft from a brand new angle, like the key to your house or your car, QI is the key to your File Security.  Period.<p>“We wanted to make digital security products available to anyone, or any company—ubiquity is really our long term goal”, said Dr. Jeannot. With the ability to adapt to any size of company, QI comes with an Enterprise Edition which is targeted at Fortune 500 companies and governments.<p>QI Enterprise provides value-added services including; File Audit Trail, Massive Decryption Prevention and GeoLocation.  These services give company’s a new way to visualize their sensitive documents as well as better control them.  Additionally, QIs Management Console allows administrators (even non-technical people) to quickly and effectively manage the devices within the enterprise by setting up policies in just a few clicks.<p>The company has just launched Qloud, the most secure cloud.  Period.<p>For further information please visit www.ithinksecurity.com/qi_corporate.php<p>PR Contact: Jessica Chalk jchalk@ithinksecurity.com",0,,1320175690

" Is this book for (movie tech) hackers?",1,"first part of Chapter 6—<p>John Marlenko Jr. had followed in his father's footsteps, joining the Navy and pursuing special forces training to become a SEAL commando, a warrior.  They put him early through Officers Candidate School upon his succeeding SEAL training, making it— as his father had, as they call enlisted troops going through OCS to make officer, rather than through the academy— stallion.  A SEAL stallion by age twenty-two, presently of age twenty-four, on leave for two months after eighteen months of duty in the middle east, visiting his hometown of Austin.
	Visiting a Western boutique, he buys a leather cowboy hat and boots, listens patiently but indifferently to the salesman's description of proper care for these articles, nodding politely but saying no thanks to the leather care products.  Outside the store, John made a few calls to old friends, looking for someone to see a matinee at the new tech plaza, but everyone had plans for the day.  So he went alone, the TV ads saying they accommodated the single viewer just as well as two, or twenty, or a hundred moviegoers.  John put the hat in the pouch of his motorcycle, put his helmet on, started the bike, and rode out to the plaza.  It opened for business more than a year ago, but there were hundreds of cars in the parking lot.  At the box office he paid for a guided tour and waited service for one viewer.  A cheerful teenage girl bounced up beside him, introducing herself as his hostess, showing him down a long corridor of entries into large theaters, opening into a great round room with doors into single rooms... ""The single viewing hall,"" she said.  ""We have booths on the other side for couples and small families, as well as the big screens for general admission.""  She led him to an available room, seated him into the viewing chair, handing him a menu and cueing the tutorial video onto the convex, parabolic screen, lit from a projector that emerged from above.  She played the tutorial, pointing out the cameras about the edge of the screen, saying they pick up on the viewer's facial expression and body language, adjusting the movie action for the best experience accordingly, and that one could watch the same movie multiple times, and see a different version each time.  ""All the acting is computer-generated,"" she said.  ""Even a lot of the scenery and music.""  Explaining further, that the computer took the composite filming of the actors, in various outfits and various readings and scenes, and computes a the movie on the go, information about the viewing uploaded in real time and the playflow sent back from the datacenter, she said, ""truly a theater of the mind.""  John ordered a beer and fresh pretzel.  ""Coming right up!"" she cheered, keying the order into her handheld tablet.  ""Your waitress will be here in a minute,"" she said, continuing the tutorial.  ""What if I don't like the movie afterwards?"" John asked.  ""Surely that's possible.""
	""Yes of course,"" the girl said.  ""It just shows what it thinks you'll appreciate the most, compared to other versions rated by other viewers.""  She explained that he could rate the experience as the credits begin to roll.  John asked about the length of the show.  The girl informed him that, if he liked, he could set a preferred duration for the viewing, otherwise payable in twenty-minute blocks.  ""Without setting the preference, and the computer picking up a strong interest in the storyline, we've had people watch more than five hours.""
	""Set it for ninety minutes, please,"" John said.
	""Sure thing,"" she chimed.  The waitress arrived with John's order.  The girl finished up the tutorial, asking John what he thought, saying it was all based on his expressions during the time they had been talking.  ""All of that was made up?"" he asked and she nodded with glee.  ""Every bit,"" she said.  ""Netflix thinks you like those actors, or that you would.""
	""How about that.""
	""Would you like to select a movie, or let it choose for you?""
	""Let it choose.""
	She drew his attention to a selector on the chair-side touch panel, showing how to prefer automatic selection for approximately ninety minutes.  After a moment, the lights lowered and a movie started.  She showed him how to order service at any time, then bowed happily and left the booth.",-1,http://amzn.to/rBhsz4,1324424968

" Library for tree/graph search?",1,"I notice that a lot of ""hard"" problems I am interested in or come across need some type of tree search like alpha-beta pruning, or beam search, or a similar algorithm. However, programming them seems like repetitively coding the same things and it is also pretty easy to make mistakes. It seems to me there should be a library that implements these algorithms, and all I should be asked to write is<p>1.   a coding for the solution, i.e., how to get a more specific solution from an incomplete solution. This will give the tree/graph structure.
2.   Given a partial solution, how to get the maximum/minimum cost, and perhaps an estimate of the cost.
3.   An Initial solution/partial solution.
4.   Maybe some sort of a verification solution.<p>I am sorry I haven't given any specific code, but I think I have explained the problem. If I can write code for the functions described above, shouldn't I be able to run a number of tree/graph search algorithms easily? Is there any user friendly library/framework that supports this easily? I'd love it to be in Python or C/C++, but would be interested to hear any suggestions.",0,http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5478683/library-for-tree-graph-search,1301921890

Yes, its true.  Waterflow is a new player on the web based project management tools market. Maybe they just want people to start to use their product like evernote did on their product. I have tested it, it is solid good product. Personally, I love the Rss idea, you don’t need to log in to your project management portal, you can see all your project progresses in your Rss reader. 
Check it out at https://www.waterflowon.com/plans_and_pricing&#60;p&#62;Share an excellent project management tool free plan with you
Waterflow is an simple and useful projects management tool. It has a free plan, which have 1G disk space,5 user and one project. That’s enough for you to manage your project. Compared with basecamp’s free plan which only have 10 M disk space. It’s very generous. Enjoy！

" My approach to guessing a gender from a first name.",13,"Hi!
A short time ago, i decided to try and build an API that would try to guess the gender of a first name. I thought this might be useful for segmenting user lists for campaigning, analytics or similar.
My first approach was to use a dataset of approved names from a few European countries. This was in the believe that most countries had lists like this (Which they don&#x27;t) and i planned to add them as i went along. I got wiser and the first feedback i got also told me that the API should be able to do probabilistic guesses and if possible, also offer some sort of localization filter to achieve more accurate guesses.
I decided to take an approach of using large, growing datasets of user profiles from social networks. Each entry containing a first name, a gender, a country_id and language_id. At last, i exposed this datamodel through http:&#x2F;&#x2F;genderize.io
It responds in JSON. Simple example: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.genderize.io?name=robin
I am now looking to get some feedback on my new approach. What do you think of this way of doing guesses. What do you think of the API? Any feedback is welcome.
The API is completely free by the way.",12,,1376584869

" New Social Video Service for iPhone Launched",1,"For Immediate Release<p>New Social Video Service for iPhone Launched<p><pre><code>             　　　 　　　 </code></pre>
Tokyo, Japan – September 14th, 2011 – Miew Inc., a subsidiary of  Samurai Incubate Inc., launched its new Social Video Service Application for iPhone, called “5Seconds”, aimed to provide new communication platform for iPhone users utilizing a 5-second video complete with audio and personalized end credit message similar to last scene of a movie.<p>Social Video Service “5Seconds” is a new type of free communication service that adds end credit, effects and messages on the 5-second movie taken on an iPhone. The length of movie is limited to five seconds; however, the concept of 5Seconds is to establish communication between users by short videos. The system allows users to easily “Take, Edit, Add Effects and Watch” movies on their iPhone.<p>“With 5Seconds, users can make cool videos that is like the last scene of the movie, share those movies on Facebook, Twitter, and 5Seconds Portal, make communication with emotions by adding end credit message, enjoy 5Seconds movies without hassles of registration or any other sign up, and manage movies easily on Album tab, sending 5Seconds contents and events on the application”, Shinnosuke Tone, CEO of Miew Inc. said.<p>5Seconds is a similar idea to that of numerous Silicon Valley related companies but instead of photo sharing with added expressions; it uses 5-second video plus the stylish effects with the ability to share on Twitter and Facebook. The time limit of 5 seconds is based on the assumption that most people are not interested in watching personal video for more than 10 seconds, similar to the concept of 140 characters for Twitter.<p>Users can share their 5-second videos to broadcast events such as trips, parties, sport activities, or simple birthday calls to facebook, personal video logs, various scenes where you can take 5 seconds video, and text messages by end credit function.<p>5seconds is currently available in English and is only available on iPhones; however, by year end, it will be able to support Android devices and aims to get 300 million users. 5seconds developers are now also thinking incorporating pre-written messages, quotes, and poems to preloaded videos that will match user’s emotion.<p>About Miew Inc.<p>Miew Inc is a subsidiary of  Samurai Incubate Inc., established in March 2011 to develop social video service software for smartphones. “5Seconds” is the service which user can add effect to the video captured by smartphones and share to Facebook and Twitter.<p>To know more of 5Seconds features, please visit http://www.miew.co.jp or email info@miew.co.jp.

" Open Source, searchable & sortable, global database for startups",1,"@fractalg is looking for anyone, preferably a team of 3 or less, who wants to work on 
An Open Source, searchable and sortable, global database for startups.
dev.startupgrid.net 
A few reasons to do this are:
• Many Startups are working on the same idea as each other but don't know it--this could help you find your competition before you start, and even alert you to competition as they emerge.
• Many startups are looking for specific things that they cannot really communicate in a clear way to everyone else. Examples:
       -- ""I'm looking for a business development cofounder."" Currently, I had to post on a bunch of startup forums. With a global database, I could just raise a flag that says ""seeking business cofounder"", then anyone who IS a potential business cofounder could simply search for that, and my startup would appear in the results. No such search exists today. Or they could simply select ""Please alert me if anyone is seeking a business cofounder."" Incidentally, many sites make money charging $50-100 for this privilege.)
• Seeing the bigger picture of Startups is becoming more important as millions are jumping on the bandwagon. 
    -- Where is most of the value and money being made in Startups? What are the trends?
    -- Who's geting funded? Who's failing? 
    -- How many new Educational Games Startups in North America are in the Beta or Growth stage?
The tech to make this happen is close (~2 months) to being done. I just need someone to help manage this process from the business development end. My only requirement is that it has to be open source. I think it can definitely make a profit.

Long-time lurker, first-time submitter.<p>A couple of nights ago, I was reading a long piece of text on my iPhone and thought how nice it would be to have Instapaper's pagination in Mobile Safari. So I made it (no App Store approval required!).<p>Once you've added the bookmark (it's a tad convoluted on the iPhone), you can open it on any page to add transparent tap zones. Tap the bottom or right side to scroll down one viewport height; tap the top or left side to scroll up one viewport height (the layout is the same as Instapaper). To temporarily disable pagination so you can interact with the page, tap the middle of the screen; tap the transparent overlay at the bottom to re-enable. Open the bookmarklet again to completely disable it.<p>I've only personally tested this on my iPhone 3G and the iPhone simulator. If you've got an iPad, Android phone, Palm Pre, or some other device with a credible WebKit browser, I'd love to know if it works fine (it probably should). If you have a fix to make it work on your device without breaking iPhone OS (iOS?) support, send it my way.<p>It also works in Safari and Chrome, but not in Firefox, Opera, and almost assuredly IE. I think it has something to do with the size of the bookmarklet--if someone can figure out a fix I'd love to accept it.<p>Feedback on the code would also be appreciated.<p>Thanks!",0,http://github.com/grantheaslip/paginate.js,1275949329

" RTP Hackers & Founders, March 18, 2011  SplatSpace",6,"Hey guys, good news... we're having another RTP Hackers &#38; Founders Meetup, and this time we are in the beautiful city of Durham, NC, thanks to the folks at SplatSpace - Durham's hackerspace.<p>This is a change from past events, which have always been held at a bar or restaurant, but I think it's a net win.  Why? Well, we don't have to compete with a bar full of people for places to sit / stand, and we don't have the noise and buzz of a full bar to deal with.  BUT... conveniently, SplatSpace is within walking distance of both a bar and a coffee shop!  So if people get tired of mingling at SplatSpace and want food/coffee/beer etc., we can migrate - individually or en masse - to one of the other establishments.<p>The other positive is that we have access to a project at SplatSpace, so if you want to bring a laptop to demo a project, or practice pitching your project or something along those lines, we can do that sort of thing.<p>It'll still be pretty unstructured and free-form, but this does give us some more options.",0,http://www.meetup.com/RTP-Hackers-Founders/events/16762340/,1299038046

" Rate my startup - CertiVox's PrivateSky",5,"I've been a long time lurker on the board, but this is my first official post. My name is Brian Spector, I'm a long time crypto geek, working in infosec for about 20 years.<p>Last week we launched a new service called PrivateSky, which is a end to end, browser to browser encryption service, for free. Our first product is the PrivateSky for Internet Explorer add-in. Yes, we will come out with Firefox and Chrome soon.<p>I'd love to see what the board thinks about what we are doing, and if so, what we could improve.<p>I hope this is the appropriate place to post this, if I'm violating policy (checked, couldn't find anything), then please do let me know and I will delete this.<p>You can get the free PrivateSky Internet Explorer add-in at:<p>https://privatesky.me<p>What does it do?<p>CertiVox's PrivateSky SaaS is a major innovation in secure inforamtion exchange. The PrivateSky for Internet Explorer Connector add-in is a whole new approach to securing confidential information posted to the web, and anyone can use it. The PrivateSky for IE add-in doesn't require multiple passwords, certificates, or complicated processes to learn. It's simple browser to browser encryption that just works. Use it to encrypt your webmail, Facebook posts and messages, LinkedIn messages and even blog posts. PrivateSky uses the AES encryption algorithm, that means it is super safe!<p>Enough with the marketing schpeel, here's what we really do:<p>We operate an encryption key management server in the cloud. Our software connects to our key server to get everyone who enrols what we call a SkyKey. You can think of this like a private key. However, we are using a new form of key agreement called non-interactive authenticated key agreement, based upon bilinear pairing mathematics. No, this is not identity based encryption, this is non-interactive key agreement. It's heady stuff, but it has suffered through 20 years of cryptanalysis and is secured by the DLP.<p>Now, the thing is, there is no public key. There is only one key, your SkyKey. But, this enables you to create ""connection keys"", which are regular AES 192 bit keys. The analogy I always use is this: Suppose every time you made a friend on Facebook, a worldly unique AES key was created between you and your friend, and could only be created between you and your friend.<p>That's what we've managed to do, but in your browser. Oh, and there is a boatload of key protection, rotation, etc., going on in the background.<p>Again, love to get some feedback. I'm the chief bottle washer at the moment so I can't promise to respond to feedback immediately, but will try my best.<p>Thank you for giving it a shot and please let 'er rip, the good, bad and ugly.<p>Cheers,
Brian",18,https://privatesky.me,1309793047

" Ready to Pay? Internet Providers want to meter Usage",4,"If Internet service providers' current experiments succeed, subscribers may end up paying for high-speed Internet based on how much material they download. Trials with such metered access, rather than the traditional monthly flat fee for unlimited connection time, offer enough bandwidth that they won't affect many consumers — yet.<p>But as more people use the Internet to watch TV and stream movies, they could bump up against the metered rates' caps, paying expensive over-use fees. Watching a movie may then require paying two fees: one for the movie, another to the cable company.<p>More and more television programming and movies are available online, through sites including Hulu, Netflix Watch Instantly, YouTube and Amazon.com's Video on Demand.<p>""This time there is a real, viable alternative"" to cable, said Bobby Tulsiani, a senior analyst at Forrester Research.<p>Most consumers probably don't realize how much bandwidth their Internet usage consumes, because they've never had to care. Time Warner, the nation's third-largest Internet service provider, in its five experimental markets if offering five gigabytes of downloaded Internet content for $29.95 per month. That translates to 15 hours of viewing standard-definition video, or 350,000 e-mails, or 170 hours of online gaming, or some combination of those activities, according to the company.

" Review my Startup. Help a guy out. ",11,"With my own experience, and others, I always thought there is a market for a service where an otherwise socially awkward guy could ask a girl a question (about anything) and get genuine advice. I wanted to make the service paid, so the women actually had some incentive to spend some time crafting a thoughtful response. Also, wanted to make everything discreet, so that women did not need to hold anything back, and guys owned the responses they paid for. At the same time, wanted money to be very nominal so that anyone could use it - so thought $2 would be just right. I split a buck with the answer provider. Guys can request responses from multiple ladies (5 responses = $10). Guys have option to reject any reponse deemed unthoughtful and request refund.<p>Income has been interesting so far. About 20 guys asked questions last month. Some of them requested multiple responses. October total $90. Through word of mouth, about 600 ladies have signed up so far to provide reponses. An email is fired every time a new request gets posted, ladies ""reserve"" the question and respond on a first-come-first-served basis and guys receive reponses within a few hours.<p>I would like to get some suggestions from the HN community as to how to make it scalable? I know there is a market for a service like this but just haven't been able to get any traction. What can I change, improve? Or is this whole concept is just flawed and I should just ""move on"".<p>Thank you for your feedback.

" Review my startup: RegistryStop, a centralized wedding registry",17,"Registry Stop grew out of my frustrations with the wedding registry process. During the process managing multiple in store registries, getting duplicate items, and just the problem of dealing with sales people became quickly frustrating. We created Registry Stop to allow couples to not worry about which stores they registered at, instead they only have to focus on the products they want. As a result we let users register anywhere, meanwhile we show their guests where they can find the best price.<p>http://www.registrystop.com<p>Our goal was to make adoption and use as simple as possible for users. Whether they started with us, or used us later into the process we wanted it to take no more than a few seconds for them to be fully ramped up on us. If they start with us, they have the ability to download an iPhone app and begin scanning barcodes immediately. If they've already registered at an existing store we search and find their registry for them, then import all of that data.<p>We'd love any feedback on any areas people are willing to offer up. In particular:
- If the message is clear
- If the signup and adding process is clear
- Styling for the target market (weddings)",10,http://www.registrystop.com,1295900884

" Sunday best for car buyers",1,"A six-month study by leading used car website www.vcars.co.uk could finally explain away Sunday’s glut of leisurely drivers. The study has revealed that the most popular time to buy a car in Britain is between 11am and 12 noon on Sunday morning.<p>Almost 20% of car buyers recorded in the study chose a lazy Sunday morning to make a purchase from VCARS stock of 120,000 cars and over 2,000 dealers. Those unable to make a Sunday purchase went back on Monday (14.8%), making it the second most popular day, with Saturday (14.5%) coming in third. Garages looking for a day off, or punters looking for a quick deal, would do well to choose Thursday when just over 10% of purchases were made.<p>VCARS Director Bob O’Connor commented: “As well as being a 24-hour online culture, Britain is now truly a seven-days-a-week economy. Hard-working Brits rarely have the time to visit garages during the week so what we’re finding is that, Monday to Friday, they collect all the relevant information from VCARS – comparing prices, makes and models across the country, finding a couple of suitable cars, downloading full vehicle spec and garage destination before physically making the trip on a Sunday.”<p>Drivers are clearly using their weekdays to collate an impressive amount of information. VCARS research also shows that, on average, surfers look at 22 cars before making their final purchase.<p>/ends/",-1,,1337263529

Terracotta sets itself apart from traditional Java distributed caches because of it’s seamless integration with most Java application servers and frameworks, and ability to cache the entire framework and code, as well as provide session clustering and replication features on a level of high-availability that is difficult to attain with such finesse and ease. This article demonstrates some of Terracotta’s session clustering and high availability features using a demo application the Terracotta engineers have created, called the Examinator.",1,http://www.thebitsource.com/2009/04/18/web-application-session-clustering-and-replication-with-terracotta-server-network-attached-memory/,1240244874

The triggering system is connected to a sufficiently secure data channel that will guarantee the security of the connection (i can’t imagine a 100% secure network but for the present matter we’ll accept this premise) through which it will receive the lottery numbers. The guns will be programmed to fire at your head at the same time if the lottery numbers do not match the ticket you played.,0,http://www.scitechexplained.com/2010/06/theory-of-nothing-written-by-russell-k-standish-the-multiverse-quantum-immortality-and-the-meaning-of-life/,1298118520

I have already gone through a few resources…all the Codecademy lessons for Ruby, CodeSchools “Try Ruby” and “Ruby Bits” series, “Mr. Neighborly’s Humble Little Ruby Book” to learn the basics of Ruby. And now I’m just getting to the tip of the iceberg with Rails. I’m currently working through M. Hartl’s popular “Rails Tutorial” and the most recent edition of “Agile Development with Rails”.<p>I’m hoping to transition to a Junior Rails developer role but am not sure of what general knowledge I need to have or what I should expect when applying to these positions. Because I’m familiar with some aspects of web development, should I be able to land a job more easily with my front-end experience and learn the ropes from my future employer or would I benefit more from buckling down for a few months and learn the inner-workings of the framework?",3,http://benjammin.herokuapp.com/?p=9,1358443016

" US helped Israel contain UN Gaza war probes: Report",1," A file photo of an Israeli tank on the Gaza border. PHOTO: AFP/FILE<p>WASHINGTON: The United States worked behind the scenes to help Israel contain UN probes into possible war crimes committed during the 2008 and 2009 Gaza war, Foreign Policy reported on Tuesday.<p>The online foreign affairs magazine cited exclusive WikiLeaks cables detailing moves by the US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to prevent a more thorough UN investigation of alleged abuses during the conflict.<p>Some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during the three-week-long Israeli offensive in December 2008 and January 2009, which was aimed at halting Palestinian rocket attacks.<p>According to one cable, Rice spoke with UN chief Ban Ki-moon three times on May 4, 2009 to urge him to remove recommendations for a wider investigation from a board of inquiry report into attacks on UN sites in Gaza.<p>Rice “underscored the importance of having a strong cover letter that made clear that no further action was needed and would close out this issue,” the US diplomatic cable said.<p>Ban said his staff was working with the Israeli delegation and “called her after the letter had been finalized to report that he believed they had arrived at a satisfactory cover letter.”<p>Later that year Israel and the United States pushed back against a similar effort to investigate the war by the UN Human Rights Council, which appointed a team led by the South African jurist Richard Goldstone.<p>The release of the Goldstone probe coincided with US efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and in another cable Rice links the two during a meeting with Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon.<p>Rice told Ayalon that Washington “is still studying the report, remains concerned about the fact-finding mission’s mandate and many of the recommendations in the report,” according to the cable.<p>She then urged him to “help us help them with progress on the peace process, saying that the report can be more easily managed if there is progress.”<p>The Goldstone report said there was evidence that both Israel and Palestinian militant groups had committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, urging independent probes on both sides.<p>Two weeks ago, Goldstone stepped back from the report, saying new information about Israel’s military actions led him to believe he had erred in concluding that Israel targeted civilians during the 22-day conflict.<p>He cited a UN committee of independent experts that followed up on the report and found that Israel “has dedicated significant resources to investigate over 400 allegations of operational misconduct in Gaza.”<p>In contrast, the Hamas, the militant group ruling Gaza, “have not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against Israel” that triggered the offensive, Goldstone wrote.<p>Israel, which bitterly opposed the investigation from the beginning, has since demanded that the United Nations rescind the report.<p>But last week, three co-authors of the report, Pakistani human rights lawyer Hina Jilani, Christine Chinvin, a professor of international law at the London School of Economics and former Irish peacekeeper Desmond Travers, rejected calls to retract it.<p>“We concur in our view that there is no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in anyways change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict,” they said in a statement to Britain’s The Guardian newspaper.",-1,http://www.pakistannationalnews.com/world/us-helped-israel-contain-un-gaza-war-probes-report/,1303304571

" Which Way Will Oil Prices Go?",1,"Saudi Arabia said on Friday that it would raise its daily output by 300,000 barrels per day … Angola is scheduled to start shipping a new blend of crude oil in July, boosting production by about 90,000 barrels a day… Iraqi oil production rose to more than 2.5 million barrels a day last week, the highest this year…<p>... and yet crude oil shrugged off all this “bad news,” threw back its soot-black face and laughed, and kept on climbing to higher prices on Monday.<p>By just about any metric, crude oil is overbought and due for a pullback. However, the Chinese may have something to say about it. The Chinese are hoarding diesel fuel ahead of hosting the Olympics this August. You see, the Chinese don’t trust their power grid, so they’re positioning emergency generators all over the place to keep the lights on if the grid goes snafu.<p>And since the prices of oil, diesel and gasoline are made on the margins, China’s demand for diesel is having an effect on what you pay at the gas pump.<p>Americans are the world’s biggest users of gasoline and oil, and Americans are cutting back their demand. So when China’s demand sets global prices, that’s a bit like the tail wagging the dog.<p>But the fact is, Chinese fuel demand is growing rapidly, buoyed by state subsidies that keep prices low for consumers and keep their magic growth engine humming along. Since we ship China more and more of our money every day in return for lead-painted toys, poisoned dog food and other gee-gaws, the government there isn’t going to run out of money to subsidize fuel anytime soon.<p>And there are about 2 billion people in China, India, and other emerging markets who want to hop in a car and drive, baby drive like big, fat Americans. In the long-term, they’ll use every gallon we don’t.<p>But we could still experience a steep, even head-snapping correction in the short term. We just need demand destruction quickly enough in the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. And we may get it.<p>U.S. jet fuel demand in April dropped to its lowest level in five years – down 6.2% to 1.549 million barrels per day.<p>Gasoline demand in the U.S. is down slightly, and could drop more. Mastercard, the nation’s second biggest credit card company, said that U.S. gasoline demand fell 5.8% in the week ending May 2 when compared to the same week a year earlier. Demand fell 2.5% from the previous week. If oil prices stay high, U.S. gasoline consumption could fall to 8 million barrels a day by the end of 2009 instead of rising very slightly to 9.33 million barrels a day as the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts.<p>And we could use a lot less. In a comparison that will surely set George Bush’s teeth on edge, your average Frenchman, for example, uses about 16% of the gasoline per capita that the average American does.<p>In the short term, we’ve noticed – as you probably have too – that it’s just when things look hottest in commodities that a reversal in one direction or another can happen. Bottom line: Oil could go either way.<p>Meanwhile, while President Bush was in the Middle East, he told OPEC nations that they're running out of oil. Well, the President already said that America is addicted to oil, so isn't that a little like a junkie telling his pusher that the pusher is running out of smack. Who do you think is really going to suffer here? Thanks for the heads-up, Georgie-boy. And OPEC has nixed the idea of calling an early meeting to boost production.
So crude oil shrugs its shoulders, and keeps climbing. We'll see what happens when the oil inventory numbers come out tomorrow.",-1,http://blogs.moneyandmarkets.com/blog/red-hot-energy-and-gold,1211487949

" Wrappled Launches: The Online Store for Kickstarter & Indiegogo Projects ",1,"Wrappled.com (Wrappled) today announced the launch of its online storefront, the first online marketplace for successfully funded Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects.<p>Crowdfunding projects have surged in popularity, sparking an array of new and innovative products geared towards consumers. While popular crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow manufacturers to bring their items to market, an inherent problem lies within for consumers who wish to locate and purchase products after the funding period has already ended.&lt;p&gt;“Because sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have insisted on being identified strictly as crowdfunding platforms, Wrappled has addressed this issue by creating an e-commerce storefront for products whose campaigns have already expired,” says Lex DeLeon, one of the founding partners of Wrappled. “With Wrappled, consumers can easily locate and purchase their favorite funded products all from one website and location.”<p>Founded in 2012, Wrappled is the one and only marketplace for unique products and projects funded through crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Wrappled seeks to offer its customers the newest and coolest crowdfunded products on a daily basis, positioning itself to be at the forefront of innovation and an expert in everything revolving around the crowdfunding process.<p>Wrappled seeks to elevate the shopping experience by pairing informative and entertaining videos with each product so that consumers can gather and glean information that isn’t easily communicated via text and&#x2F;or standalone images (e.g. how the product works, its various applications, where it works best, etc.).<p>Wrappled’s product videos provide consumers with an entertaining and interactive way of learning how each item can fit and be useful in their everyday lives.",-1,http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/2/prweb10446849.htm,1371090325

But beliefs reflect value in such a way that beliefs considered “good” or “bad” are better characterized as having “lots of value” or “little value” respectively. There is a tendency upon arriving at a particular belief to cease deriving value that could alter the belief - doing so is often perceived as a weakness. The belief in value, credism, mandates that for progress to occur, humans must constantly engage in the process of deriving value. Without it, the fabric of society deteriorates as beliefs become hollow with rhetoric, and progress stands still.",0,,1434793843

" is this a D*ck move? how do you deal with trial period abuses?",1,"So I run a small service, mostly a hobby side project http://www.feedsapi.com and start seeing a trend, the user who abuse the system the most are all users with the cheapest plan, so I got this email today from one of our users, let's call him John. John subscribed to our cheapest plan with a 30 days trial period on a recurrent monthly base, and a couple of days later, cancelled the subscription, but kept using the service. We cancelled the subscription after this period and here comes John again for a new subscription to the same cheapest plan with a reduced 5 days Trial period.
And 30 seconds later, I get an email from John asking me to please activate his account:&#60;p&#62;John: Dear can you active my API key : ApiKey-Here&#60;p&#62;Me: Hello Dear John,
due to suspicious activities trying to abuse the trial system, your API Key will be activated after the trial period and only after receiving the first payment. You signed up for the first time on the 25. Oct 2011 and cancelled your subscription after receiving your API Key . Thanks&#60;p&#62;John: dear i will pay now if you need&#60;p&#62;Me: Sorry Dear John,
those are our rules/ToS , we normally ban people doing this, it's not about the payment as such, it's just the rules and as I said, you would have normally been banned. The alternative I can offer you is a yearly payment ($5*12) or you can wait for the trial period to be over (5 days), and once we see the payment coming in, we will activate your key.Thanks for understanding.&#60;p&#62;No follow up from John.&#60;p&#62;So my question to you, how do you deal with people trying to abuse your trial-period and frequently creating new accounts?&#60;p&#62;Another trend I see: People with the cheapest plan are those with the most support requests, and some of the people on the cheapest plan use it for professional purposes (John was doing this as well).&#60;p&#62;Was this the best way to handle this? Any suggestions are welcome, I'm thinking of getting rid of the ""Personal use"" plan.

http://www.7-people.com/<p>This is a story about one man’s journey to the most terrifying place in the world – rock bottom. Everyone’s rock bottom is different, but for Paul Browning, it came in the form of a long legal battle to save his business, crippling financial problems, and the end of his marriage. During that time, Paul felt desperate, alone, and very frightened, and he almost lost the one thing he needed to keep going – faith. If it weren’t for the support of seven very special individuals, all of whom had been through their own personal hell and not only survived but thrived, Paul might not have made it. With their words of encouragement and advice, Paul was able to face up to the changes he had to make, and he learned some very valuable lessons along the way. These lessons can help you, too. 7 People Saved My Life is more than just a story. It is a survival manual for anyone who is struggling to cope with a life crisis, going through a hard time, or trying to make some meaning out of a traumatic life event. Paul Browning worked as a police officer in the UK for 12 years before embarking upon a career in IT. He has been through enough shit to last a lifetime, but he came out on the other side stronger and wiser – and with his sense of humor intact! Forget the usual self-help manuals. This is the real thing.<p>PROMO Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA66MwPVw4I<p>Paul Browning

"""A stadium is a healthcare institution too""",1,"&quot;A stadium is a healthcare institution too!&quot;. With these words Peter Harrach, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democrats party (KDNP) answered the question why soccer stadiums are financed throughout the whole country, yet they won&#x27;t finance a healthcare institute for sick children which is at the brink of bankruptcy.<p>The internationally known Peto institute (see www.peto.hu&#x2F;en&#x2F;), founded in 1940 by Andrew Peto is a healthcare institute for children suffering from a damage in the central nervous system which caused motorical disabilities. It was funded by the Peto public foundation and the British government but has later been taken over by a Hungarian insurance company with close connections to the governing party of Hungary. Ever since the takeover the Peto institute struggled with financial challenges and is now about to close its gates due to insolvency because the Hungarian parliament recently voted against the financial injection for the institute.<p>They rather finance soccer stadia because you know: &quot;A stadium is a healthcare institute too&quot;. I wonder how many children with disabilities will be allowed to play soccer in one of the stadia...<p>The captions in the following picture say: &quot;Viktor (Orban, prime minister) look! Can the Peto institute get money now?&quot;
