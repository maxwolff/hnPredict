I suspect it is this way because it came out of the minds of designers rather than programmers...and DHH's attitude is ""F You"" so it will never improve...  but maybe I'm just spoiled having used WebObjects.   <p>I ended up writing my own web app platform in about 3 months-- custom language, integrated persistence engine and http-server, no-thought-required concurrency... so I'm happy now.   I'm just kinda surprised that more people haven't done this.<p>If you don't have the time to do your own solution, use Erlyweb (which is hampered by being ""Rails for erlang"") or WebObjects (which is hampered by running on Java). <p>Anyway, I expect that the outperformance of Erlyweb compared to rails will be more dramatic-- in excess of 10 to 1, when running a more complex application, and even higher when running on a multicore cpu.",11,http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2007/12/09/erlyweb-vs-ruby-on-rails-ec2-performance-showdown/
